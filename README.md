<h3>How do i use this?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fork the repo</li>
  <li>Clone it</li>
  <li>Open the project in Android Studio and wait for the gradle build to finish</li>
  <li>Run the app !</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h3> AITO in our project!!</h3>
 <p> We never had used AITO before but the challenge really seemed amazing to us so we wanted to do it. Aito made recommending and predicting things easier for us and we would definitely use it again in any upcoming hackathons beacuse it made things really easy for us</p>
